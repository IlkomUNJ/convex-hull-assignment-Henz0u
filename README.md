# Identity
Name : Muhammad Zufar Al Faruqi

# AI usage
  mostly on Perplexity
1. create a qt6 code that consist of: A canvas , Run Convex Hull Button , and Clear Button
2. Implement both slow convex hull and convex hull algorithm <insert the algorithm from deberg.pdf> and write the iteration number on canvas
3. Asking both gpt and gemini to double check if the algoritm give the correct amount of iterations
4. why i got 12 iterations on Slow Convex Hull (O(nÂ³))  for 3 vertices, when it supposed to be 6
and there is something wrong with fast convex hull too the total iterations should be 2-4, and i got 8 iterations?
5. please fix the algorithm, the answer i supposed to get is:
slow 
3 points = 6 iteration
4 = 24
5 = 60

fast
3 = 2-4
4 = 4-8
5 = 6-12

# Collaboration usage
i have a collaboration with Muhammad Vlas, we had a conversation just to recheck if our algorithm gives the right amount of iteration, this explain the 3rd query i write.
